learning hydrodynamics 

learning about donor cell advection, slope and flux limiters, Burger's eqns vs Riemann eqns.
Almost got a Roe solver, or I do but I know I still have to iron some kinks out (like how/if a flux limiter applies to a Roe solver, or if only slope limiters do?)

	TODO

1D:
- more implicit options? fixed point?  some Newton/Levenberg Marquardt/BFGS stuff?

2D:
- constant boundary still buggy
- hydrostatic pressure still buggy
	- get Rayleigh-Taylor instability demo working
- arbitrary boundaries possibly from a boundary buffer
	- Von Karman vortex street demo
- mouse input for velocity and for boundary painting
- FBO-based advection or particle simulation for streamline tracing
- implicit Gauss-Seidel

2D-GPU
- hydrostatic pressure at all
- constant boundary options at all
- Riemann solver is unstable -- eigenbasis accuracy issues
- CFL is inaccurate.  something about the reduce kernel, if you have the fragment write out 1's, the float32 texture reader gets back .5
- implicit Jacobi

all:
- swappable equations of state
	- MHD
	- ADM
	- elastic solids?
- AMR
