learning hydrodynamics

learning about donor cell advection, slope and flux limiters, Burger's eqns vs Riemann eqns.
Almost got a Roe solver, or I do but I know I still have to iron some kinks out (like how/if a flux limiter applies to a Roe solver, or if only slope limiters do?)

	TODO

1D:
- finish 'Backward Euler + Gauss-Seidel' & 'Riemann / Roe'
- more implicit options? fixed point?  some Newton/Levenberg Marquardt/BFGS stuff?
- render as a good ol fashioned white line with circles or boxes or x's or something as gridpoints
	- add a toggle for what variable is displayed
	- overlay exact solution
- HLL - incorporate flux limiter so it works at all
- AMR - isn't working unless we specifically set the flux limiter to .. (donor cell?).  the book says to use HLL, so get that working?


2D:
- custom inflow boundary conditions
	- Von Karman vortex street demo (need viscousity, i.e. Navier-Stokes, first)
- mouse input for velocity and for boundary painting
- FBO-based advection or particle simulation for streamline tracing
- implicit Gauss-Seidel ... and then add arbitrary boundaries to it

2D-GPU
- solid: get cylinder working with Roe version
- mirror boundary conditions
	- then enable hydrostatic pressure
- constant boundary options at all
- Riemann solver arbitrary boundaries
- implicit Jacobi solver

2D unstructured? 3D? 3D-GPU? 3D-unstructured? 3D-GPU-unstructured?


all:
- Entropy fix.
	- CFD codes has this in euler_solver_v0.f90, Toro describes it on p.364
- Artificial viscosity
- swappable equations of state
	- MHD
	- ADM
	- elastic solids?
- AMR

Hyperbolic Navier-Stokes:
