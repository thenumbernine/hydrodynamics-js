learning hydrodynamics

learning about donor cell advection, slope and flux limiters, Burger's eqns vs Riemann eqns.
Almost got a Roe solver, or I do but I know I still have to iron some kinks out (like how/if a flux limiter applies to a Roe solver, or if only slope limiters do?)

	TODO

1D:
- finish 'Backward Euler + Gauss-Seidel' & 'Riemann / Roe'
- more implicit options? fixed point?  some Newton/Levenberg Marquardt/BFGS stuff?

2D:
- remove pressure source from Roe version
- custom inflow boundary conditions
	- Von Karman vortex street demo
- mouse input for velocity and for boundary painting
- FBO-based advection or particle simulation for streamline tracing
- implicit Gauss-Seidel ... and then add arbitrary boundaries to it

2D-GPU
- remove pressure source from Roe version
- GPU accuracy issues compared to CPU
	- check out source:hvidtfeldts.net/WebGL-DP/webgl.html
- mirror boundary conditions
	- then enable hydrostatic pressure
- constant boundary options at all
- Riemann solver is unstable -- eigenbasis accuracy issues
- Riemann solver arbitrary boundaries
- looks like the speed of sound isn't dying down like it is in the CPU version.
- implicit Jacobi solver

2D unstructured? 3D? 3D-GPU? 3D-unstructured? 3D-GPU-unstructured?


all:
- Roe solvers are not supposed to have flux limiters directly applied to them (but rather slope limiters?), but I'm doing this, and seeing oscillations.  I should fix it.
- slope limiters (and two neighbors over) correctly working with arbitrary boundaries
- swappable equations of state
	- MHD
	- ADM
	- elastic solids?
- AMR
