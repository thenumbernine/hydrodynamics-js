learning hydrodynamics 

learning about donor cell advection, slope and flux limiters, Burger's eqns vs Riemann eqns.
Almost got a Roe solver, or I do but I know I still have to iron some kinks out (like how/if a flux limiter applies to a Roe solver, or if only slope limiters do?)

	TODO

1D:
- more implicit options? fixed point?  some Newton/Levenberg Marquardt/BFGS stuff?

2D:
- custom inflow boundary conditions
	- Von Karman vortex street demo
- mouse input for velocity and for boundary painting
- FBO-based advection or particle simulation for streamline tracing
- implicit Gauss-Seidel ... and then add arbitrary boundaries to it

2D-GPU
- mirror boundary conditions
	- hydrostatic pressure
- constant boundary options at all
- Riemann solver is unstable -- eigenbasis accuracy issues
- Riemann solver arbitrary boundaries
- CFL is inaccurate.  looks like the speed of sound isn't dying down like it is in the CPU version.
- - new 'scratch texture' lone texture used for double-buffer targets is causing CFL to die even faster than usual . . . hmm . . . 
- - - once CFL is implemented, enable hydrostatic force in the UI
- implicit Jacobi

2D unstructured? 3D? 3D-GPU? 3D-unstructured? 3D-GPU-unstructured?


all:
- Roe solvers are not supposed to have flux limiters directly applied to them (but rather slope limiters?), but I'm doing this, and seeing oscillations.  I should fix it.
- slope limiters (and two neighbors over) correctly working with arbitrary boundaries
- swappable equations of state
	- MHD
	- ADM
	- elastic solids?
- AMR
